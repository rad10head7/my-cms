# MY CMS

MY CMS - MEAN Stack CMS & Blogging Platform

Documentation will eventually be added to README and my blog site.

For now, to get started:

make sure you have Node and MongoDB installed on your system
clone and cd to server directory

```
npm install
node server.js
```

load localhost:3000 in your server. You will be asked for a username and password for your first visit. After logging in you will first be taken to the admin page for posts and pages. But you can also go to the home page to see the simple client provided written in AngularJS. If you make any changes to the client, make sure you run gulp on the command line afterwards to re-compile everything. Enjoy!
